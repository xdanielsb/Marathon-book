Selection sort
Suppose an array A
Note : in this pseudocode the minimun size of the array is 1 for that reason is  i>0

for index = 0 to A.length                       //Iterate over the all array
    index_min_value = index                     //Variable that stores the index of the smallest number
    for aux_index = index+1 to A.length         //Iterate over the elements that are higher than the current inasmuch as the previous element have already sorted.
        if A[aux_index]< A[index_min_value]     //Conditional to compare
            index_min_value = aux_index         //change the index of less value
    aux = A[index]                              //Swap the values
    A[index] = A[index_min_value]
    A[index_min_value] = aux
